LLM prompts module for movie knowledge graph interactions.

This module contains lambda functions that generate prompts for different
language model interactions needed throughout the application, including
fixing Cypher queries, generating Cypher from natural language, and
summarizing query results.
"""

# Prompt for generating Cypher queries from natural language questions
# Takes a user query, vector search context, and knowledge graph ontology
# Returns a prompt instructing the LLM how to generate an appropriate Cypher query
cypher_generation_prompt = lambda query, context, ontology: f"""
You are an assistant working with a Neo4j movie database.
You must translate a user’s natural language question into a precise Cypher query.

Use the ontology, context, and user query provided below to guide your response.
Each section is clearly delimited to help you parse and use the input properly.

<<<ONTOLOGY>>>
{ontology}
<<<END ONTOLOGY>>>

<<<USER QUESTION>>>
{query}
<<<END USER QUESTION>>>

<<<VECTOR SEARCH CONTEXT>>>
{context}
<<<END VECTOR SEARCH CONTEXT>>>

Your task is to generate a valid Cypher query that accurately answers the user's question using the ontology and relevant context.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR CYPHER QUERIES:
1. Begin with Cypher clauses like MATCH, OPTIONAL MATCH, CREATE, MERGE, UNWIND, CALL, WITH, RETURN.
2. DO NOT escape characters (\\n, \\t, etc.) or include markdown formatting like triple backticks (``` or ```cypher).
3. Only use properties, labels, and relationships defined in the ontology.
4. Apply appropriate WHERE clauses to filter results according to the user’s intent.
5. Use the context to disambiguate entity types or relationships, especially where names or roles are similar.
6. Ensure the RETURN clause clearly specifies what to return (e.g., title, overview, release date).
7. Structure the query for readability and correctness — do not skip clauses.
8. If unsure or information is missing, generate the best-effort query based on context, and make assumptions explicit in the Cypher query as comments if needed (optional).

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Only return the Cypher query — no explanation, formatting, markdown, or prose. Just the query itself.
"""

# Prompt for summarizing Cypher query results in natural language
# Takes the original user query, Cypher results, result count, and formatted results
# Returns a prompt instructing the LLM to generate a human-readable summary
summarize_results_prompt = lambda query, cypher_results, result_count, formatted_cypher_results: f"""
You are a friendly movie assistant helping users find films that match their preferences.

<<<USER QUESTION>>>
{query}
<<<END USER QUESTION>>>

<<<CYPHER QUERY EXECUTED>>>
{cypher_results.get("query", "No query available")}
<<<END CYPHER QUERY>>>

<<<RESULT COUNT>>>
{result_count}
<<<END RESULT COUNT>>>

<<<FORMATTED RESULTS (TRUNCATED TO 4000 CHAR IF TOO LONG)>>>
{formatted_cypher_results[:4000] if result_count > 0 else "No results found."}
<<<END FORMATTED RESULTS>>>

Your task:
1. Summarize the top 3–5 movie results as if you’re enthusiastically recommending them to a friend at a movie club.
2. For each movie, include:
   - Title (required)
   - A complete but concise overview (required)
   - Optional helpful metadata like release year, genre, or standout elements (e.g., actor, theme, director)
3. Relate each recommendation to the user’s question (e.g., genre, actor mentioned, theme requested).
4. Make it personal, natural, and engaging — like you’ve seen these movies and are excited to share them.

IF RESULTS = 0:
- Offer thoughtful reasons why (e.g., query too broad/narrow, data gap)
- Provide 1–2 helpful tips to refine the query for better results next time
- Keep the tone helpful and constructive

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT list raw data.
- DO NOT repeat the Cypher query.
- DO NOT just copy & paste the input — transform the results into meaningful narrative.

Your response should be friendly, clear, and insightful — like a real conversation between movie lovers.
