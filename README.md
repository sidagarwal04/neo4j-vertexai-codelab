# Neo4j + Vertex AI Codelab

A movie recommendation application that combines Neo4j's graph database capabilities with Google Cloud's Vertex AI for semantic search and natural language movie recommendations.

## üìù Blog Post

Check out the detailed explanation of this project in the blog post: [Building an Intelligent Movie Search with Neo4j and Vertex AI](https://sidagarwal04.medium.com/building-an-intelligent-movie-search-with-neo4j-and-vertex-ai-a38c75f79cf7)

## üöÄ Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered movie recommendation engine using:

- **Neo4j**: Graph database for storing movie data and vector embeddings
- **Google Vertex AI**: For generating text embeddings and natural language processing
- **Gradio**: For creating a simple web interface

The system uses semantic search through vector embeddings generated by Vertex AI's text-embedding models to find movies based on natural language queries, and then leverages Gemini to produce conversational responses.

## üé¨ Live Demo

You can try out the deployed versions of the chatbot:

- **Hugging Face Spaces Deployment**: [Movies Recommendations Chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sidagarwal04/movies-recommendations-chatbot)
- **Google Cloud Run Deployment**: [Movies Chatbot](https://movie-reco-258362460261.us-central1.run.app)

## üß© How It Works

1. **Data Processing**: Movie data is loaded into Neo4j graph database
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Text embeddings are generated for movie descriptions using Vertex AI
3. **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity is used to match user queries with relevant movies
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Gemini generates human-like responses based on the matches

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- `chatbot.py`: Main application with Gradio interface for movie recommendations
- `generate_embeddings.py`: Script to generate vector embeddings for movie data
- `graph_build.py`: Script to populate Neo4j with movie data
- `example.env`: Template for environment variables
- `normalized_data/`: Directory containing movie data

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Neo4j database (can be self-hosted or [Aura DB](https://console.neo4j.io/)(**recommended**))
- Google Cloud account with Vertex AI API enabled
- Service account with appropriate permissions for Vertex AI

### Environment Configuration

1. Clone this repository
2. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and fill in your configuration:
   ```
   NEO4J_URI=your-neo4j-connection-string
   NEO4J_USER=your-neo4j-username
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password
   PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   LOCATION=your-gcp-location
   ```
3. Create a service account in Google Cloud and download the JSON key file
4. Place the service account key in the project directory (referenced in `generate_embeddings.py`)

### Installation

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install neo4j vertexai gradio langchain_google_vertexai python-dotenv
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application

### 1. Build the Graph Database

First, load movie data into Neo4j:

```bash
python graph_build.py
```


### 2. Generate Embeddings

Generate vector embeddings for movie descriptions:

```bash
python generate_embeddings.py
```

**Embedding CSV Utilities**:
- `generate_embeddings_to_csv.py`: A one-time script used to generate `movie_embeddings.csv`, which contains pre-computed vector embeddings for movies.
- `export_embeddings_to_csv.py`: A utility script to export existing embeddings from Neo4j to a CSV file.

**Loading Embeddings Directly from CSV**:

If you want to skip generating embeddings and load precomputed embeddings (in a CSV file) directly into Neo4j, you have two options:

**a. Running Cypher Directly in Neo4j Aura Console**

You can load the CSV file directly into Neo4j using the following Cypher query:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://storage.googleapis.com/neo4j-vertexai-codelab/movie_embeddings.csv' AS row
WITH row
MATCH (m:Movie {tmdbId: toInteger(row.tmdbId)})
SET m.embedding = apoc.convert.fromJsonList(row.embedding)
```

**b. Using the Python Script**

Alternatively, you can run the load_embeddings.py script, which automates this process via the Neo4j Python driver.
```bash
python load_embeddings.py
```

### 3. Start the Recommender Chatbot

Launch the Gradio web interface:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:7860` by default.

## üöÄ Deploying to Cloud Run
Before deploying to Cloud Run, ensure your `requirements.txt` file includes all necessary dependencies for Neo4j and Vertex AI integration. Additionally, you need a `Dockerfile` to containerize your application for deployment.

Both requirements.txt and Dockerfile are present in this repository:
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the application.
- `Dockerfile`: Defines the container environment, including the base image, required packages, and how the application is executed.

If you want to deploy this application to Google Cloud Run for production use, follow these steps:

### 1. Set up Environment Variables

```bash
# Set your Google Cloud project ID
export GCP_PROJECT='your-project-id'  # Change this

# Set your preferred region
export GCP_REGION='us-central1'
```

### 2. Create the Repository and Build the Container Image

```bash
# Set the Artifact Registry repository name
export AR_REPO='your-repo-name'  # Change this

# Set your service name
export SERVICE_NAME='movies-chatbot'  # Change if needed

# Create the Artifact Registry repository
gcloud artifacts repositories create "$AR_REPO" \
  --location="$GCP_REGION" \
  --repository-format=Docker

# Configure Docker to use Google Cloud's Artifact Registry
gcloud auth configure-docker "$GCP_REGION-docker.pkg.dev"

# Build and submit the container image
gcloud builds submit \
  --tag "$GCP_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$GCP_PROJECT/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME"
```

### 3. Deploy to Cloud Run
Before deployment, ensure your requirements.txt file is properly configured with all necessary dependencies for your Neo4j and VertexAI integration.

#### Setting Environment Variables from `.env` File
Before deploying the application to Cloud Run, ensure that all required environment variables are set. If you are running the deployment from VS Code locally, you can extract environment variables from the `.env` file and pass them dynamically to Cloud Run.

```bash
ENV_VARS=$(grep -v '^#' .env | sed 's/ *= */=/g' | xargs -I{} echo -n "{},") 
ENV_VARS=${ENV_VARS%,}
```
This ensures that all environment variables are automatically included during deployment, eliminating the need for manual entry. Once set, you can proceed with the gcloud run deploy command.

The following command reads the .env file, removes commented lines, formats the variables, and prepares them for deployment:
```bash
gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE_NAME" \
  --port=8080 \
  --image="$GCP_REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$GCP_PROJECT/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME" \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --region=$GCP_REGION \
  --platform=managed \
  --project=$GCP_PROJECT \
  --set-env-vars="GCP_PROJECT=$GCP_PROJECT,GCP_REGION=$GCP_REGION,$ENV_VARS"
```

After deployment, your application will be accessible at a URL like:
`https://movies-chatbot-[unique-id].us-central1.run.app/`

Note: 
- Your `requirements.txt` should list all Python dependencies. 
- Make sure your application's `Dockerfile` is set up properly to run in a containerized environment. The `Dockerfile` should include a `pip install -r requirements.txt` command to ensure all dependencies are installed during the container build process.
- You'll need to include your service account credentials (unless running from Google Cloud Shell directly) and environment variables in the container.
